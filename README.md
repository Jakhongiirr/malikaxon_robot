When OpenAI first introduced chatgpt, it wasn't good at uzbek language, so I created a telegram bot which stands between a user and chatgpt playing the "translator" role with the help of google's translation API.
It attracted many users, but unfortunately I had to stop it because it was free, and I didn't want to cover the expanses of servers and APIs...
